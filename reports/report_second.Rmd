# Database 

- to store data for processing a PostgreSQL database was set up (Version 9.5 on Linux Ubuntu 16.04)


# Dictionaries

- page title information are only provided for the last 3 months: https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/pagetitles/
- wikipedia dumps could only be found for the last months: https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/static_html_dumps/
- there are however page title dumps some very early and very specific points in time 2007 -2008: https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/static_html_dumps/ 
- it was not possible to obtain information on page history of that kind that would allow t obuild a graph of old page titles or reconstruct page merges, splits and so on 
- dictionary tables are of the folloowing form:



```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS dict_de (
    page_id serial,
    page_name text unique not null 
  );
```
